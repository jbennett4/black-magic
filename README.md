11/5/2019 - Hot, security related, update:
  Padding functionality has been removed (commented out), due to unsafe use of Python string format method.  Functionality will be reintroduced later.  See issue #1.


This is a relatively simple templating engine I developed for another project (forthcoming).  This was originally written in Common Lisp (code available on request), back in January 2019 for something I call variable pathing.  I've used this for a couple different projects now.

After consideration, I'm releasing this early as its usefulness far extends beyond my other project.

Future Plans:

  Documentation and Examples!

  Variable globbing (or regex?)

There are no plans of adding branching or looping, as this is intended on being
as light as possible.

Contributions welcome!
