This is a relatively simple templating engine I developed for another project (forthcoming).

After consideration, I'm releasing this early as its usefulness far extends beyond my other project.

Future Plans:

Documentation and Examples!

Variable globbing (or regex?)

Filters
- Uppercase
- Lowercase
- First letter of word
- First letter of all words
- Pre & Post padding with given character

There are no plans of adding branching or looping, as this is intended on being
as light as possible.

Contributions welcome!
